Nodetiles-init
================

This is an example webserver for use with the **[nodetiles-core](http://github.com/codeforamerica/nodetiles-core)** library, a fully-featured map rendering library for Node.js. This code is meant to be a convenient starting place for using Nodetiles to build a slippy-map &mdash; including Leaflet, Wax, and default asset/image routes &mdash; but is by no means only way to use the nodetiles-core library.
